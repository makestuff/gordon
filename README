GORDON FLASH PROGRAMMER

This is a rough command-line application to program FPGA flash chips. At the
moment it only handles the iCEblink40's SPI-flash, connected to the onboard AVR.
Eventually I'd like to make this more generic, dealing with direct and indirect
connections to the flash (indirect using the spi-talk & spi-master designs).
Also, since all the hard work for maintaining a database of flash chips and
associated programming algorithms has already been done by the flashrom project
(http://www.flashrom.org), it makes sense to re-use some of that work at a
future date, hence the choice of a flashrom-compatible license (GPLv2).
